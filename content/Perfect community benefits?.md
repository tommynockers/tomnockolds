When we think of a community in the context of a local energy project, what are the optimal benefits the local community might receive? I argue the best outcome is to deliver benefits that reflect the real desires and motivations of the local community.

This article in ReNEWS with the title **_"Scottish project 'perfect example' of community benefits"_** caught my eye. It describes the Kype Muir Wind Farm, developed by Banks Renewables who are based in Hamilton (Scotland).

This very large, private development, seemingly delivered the minimum level of community benefit - £5,000 per MW for a 155 MW development makes for £775,000 each year. So in that regard they are _perfectly_ on-target for achieving the minimum level per the guidelines. I would say far from perfect.
