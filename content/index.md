Thank you for visiting. I did not create this site for visitors. It exists for my benefit, not yours. Having said that, the reason this works (for me) is the possibility of having visitors (like you) who might read my words. So I offer a heartfelt **thank you** for visiting.

This site hosts my “memex” or “commonplace book”. What is a memex? Find out by reading the first entry - [[The Memex Method (Hello World)]].

Maybe one day this site will be more about your needs than mine. Until then, I hope you find what you are looking for.
